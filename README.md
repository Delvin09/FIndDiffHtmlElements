Test project for AgileEngine.
This app can find same html elements in two files - origin and diff.

You can start program with samples to watch sample result.
Just make sure that next to the exe file there is a Samples directory with files that have in the names 'diff' and 'origin' and the .html extensions.

Also you can start app with keys:
  -o <origin_html_file_path>  -> a path for origin html file
  -d <diff_html_file_path>    -> a path for diff html file
  -id <id_attribute_value>    -> id of element in origin file
